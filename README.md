# Ratarb

A number of utilities for dealing with Sharpe ratio, the Sharpe ratio of the
Markowitz portfolio, and, in general, overfit of trading strategies based on
(in-sample) Sharpe statistics.

A popular joke around the office goes as follows:

	"You want to know what rat-arb is? Give me twenty dollars: that's rat-arb."

You had to be there.
